# Amenallah Hsoumi Personal Website

Hello, this is the source code for my [personal website](https://www.amenallah.com).

## Technologies used

* [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

This is a static website hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## How it works

The static html pages are generated everytime something is pushed into master, the content folder is used as a database, and the data inside is
provided into the app using [nuxt-content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/).
